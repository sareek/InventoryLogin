# InventoryLogin
Its a simple inventory system for record keeping of items purchased and available in different departments of a college. It can be used for inserting items, updating them also for searching items by name or faculty and to keep records of items purchased. It also has some other features you can check them out.



This inventory system uses mysql database and hence for its proper implementation one must have knowledge of its database and its design.
Basically, it uses database with name practise, yes i know correct spelling is practice but still database name is practise :) and it 
has two tables named items and purchased_items.
